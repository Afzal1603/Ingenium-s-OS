# üñ•Ô∏è Ingenium's OS

**Ingenium's OS** is a browser-based simulation of a simple, graphical user interface (GUI) operating system. It is designed to mimic the look and feel of a basic OS environment without being a full-fledged operating system. This project is a front-end simulation and runs entirely in the browser.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is not a real operating system. It is a **simulation** for educational and demonstrative purposes only.
